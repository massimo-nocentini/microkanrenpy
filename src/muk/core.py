    Laws
    ====

    *law of fresh*
        if x is fresh, then unify(v, x) succeeds and associates x with v    

    *law of unify*
        unify(v, w) is the same as unify(w, v)

    *law of conde*
        to get more values from conde, pretend that the successful conde line
        has failed, refreshing all variables that got an association from that
        line

    Commandments
    ============

    *second*
        to transform a function whose value is not a Boolean into a function
        whose value is a goal, add an extra argument to hold its value, replace
        `cond` with `conde`, and unnest each question and answer.

# STATE STREAMS {{{

def mplus(streams, interleaving):
    '''
    It enumerates the states space ``streams``, using different strategies
    according to ``interleaving``.

    In order to understand states enumeration can be helpful to use a matrix,
    where we associate a row to each stream of states α belonging to
    ``streams``.  Since ``streams`` is an ``iter`` obj over a *countably*,
    possibly infinite, set of *states streams*, the matrix could have infinite
    rows.  In parallel, since each states stream α lying on a row is a ``iter``
    obj over a *countably*, possibly infinite, set of *satisfying states*, the
    matrix could have infinite columns; therefore, the matrix we are building
    could be infinite in both dimensions. So, let ``streams`` be represented as follows:


    .. math::

        \left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}        
        s_{00} & s_{01} & s_{02} & s_{03} & \\ldots \\\\
        s_{10} & s_{11} & s_{12} & \\ldots &        \\\\
        s_{20} & s_{21} & \\ldots &        &         \\\\
        s_{30} & \\ldots &        &        &         \\\\
        \\ldots &        &        &        &         \\\\
        \\end{array}\\right)

    In order to enumerate this infinite matrix we have the following strategies:

    *depth-first*
        Enumerates a stream α committed to it until it is saturated or continue to yield its
        ``state`` objects forever; in other words, it enumerates row by row. For the sake of clarity,
        assume the first :math:`k` streams are finite and the :math:`k`-th is the first to be infinite, hence
        we are in the following context:

        .. math::

            \left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}        
            s_{00} & s_{01} & \\ldots & s_{0i_{0}} \\\\
            s_{10} & s_{11} & \\ldots & s_{1i_{1}} \\\\
            \ldots_{\\triangle} \\\\
            s_{k-1, 0} & s_{k-1,1} & \\ldots &  s_{k-1,i_{k-1}} \\\\
            s_{k0} & s_{k1} & \\ldots &  \ldots &  \ldots \\\\
            s_{k+1, 0} & \\ldots &        &   \\\\
            \\ldots &        &        &   \\\\
            \\end{array}\\right)

        so enumeration proceeds as follows: :math:`s_{00}, s_{01},\\ldots,
        s_{0i_{0}}, s_{10}, s_{11}, \\ldots, s_{1i_{1}}, \\ldots_{\\triangle}, s_{k-1,0},
        s_{k-1, 1},\\ldots, s_{k-1,i_{k-1}}, s_{k0}, s_{k1},\\ldots` yielding from stream :math:`\\alpha_{k}` forever,
        *never* reaching :math:`s_{k+1, 0}`.

    *breadth-first*
        Enumerates interleaving *state* objects belonging to adjacent streams,
        lying on the same column; in other words, it enumerates column by
        column. If ``streams`` is an iterator over an infinite set of streams,
        the it enumerates only the very first ``state`` objects, namely
        :math:`s_{00}, s_{10}, s_{20}, s_{30},\ldots`. 
        
        The following is a straighforward implementation::

            from itertools import chain

            while True:
                try: 
                    α = next(streams)
                except StopIteration: 
                    break
                else:
                    try:
                        s = next(α) # s : state 
                    except StopIteration:
                        continue
                    else:
                        yield s
                        streams = chain(streams, [α])

    *dovetail*
        Enumerates interleaving `state` objects lying on the same *diagonal*,
        resulting in a *fair scheduler* in the sense that *every* satisfying
        ``state`` object will be reached, eventually. For the sake of clarity,
        enumeration proceeds as follows: 
        
        .. math::

            s_{00}, s_{10}, s_{01}, s_{20}, s_{11}, s_{02}, s_{30}, s_{21},
            s_{12}, s_{03}, \\ldots

        providing a *complete* enumeration strategy.


    :param iter stream: an iterator over a *countable* set of ``state``-streams
    :param bool interleaving: enumeration strategy selector: *dovetail* if ``interleaving`` else *depth-first*
    :return: an ``iter`` object over satisfying ``state`` objects

                                                s_{20} & s_{21} & \\ldots &        &         \\\\
                                                s_{30} & \\ldots &        &        &         \\\\
                                                \\ldots &        &        &        &         \\\\

    After the mapping obj is built, it is consumed as argument by ``mplus`` to
    enumerate the states space.

    Moreover, a recursive implementation can be written as found in *The
    Reasoned Schemer*, but in some cases it raises ``RecursionError`` due to
    Python limitation on stack usage::

        try:
            s = next(α) # s : state 
        except StopIteration:
            yield from fail()
        else:
            β = g(s)
            γ = bind(α, g, mplus)
            yield from mplus(iter([β, γ]))

    which produces the following states space:

    .. math::

        \\alpha = \left( \\begin{array}{c}s_{0}\\\\s_{1}\\\\s_{2}\\\\ s_{3}\\\\ \\ldots\\end{array}\\right)
          \stackrel{bind(\\alpha, g)}{\\mapsto} \left( \\begin{array}{l}        
                                                s_{00} \, s_{01} \, s_{02} \, s_{03} \, s_{04} \,s_{05} \,\\ldots \\\\
                                                \left( \\begin{array}{l}
                                                s_{10} \, s_{11} \, s_{12} \, \\ldots \,        \\\\
                                                \left( \\begin{array}{l}        
                                                s_{20} \, s_{21} \, \\ldots \,        \,         \\\\
                                                \left( \\begin{array}{l}        
                                                s_{30} \, \\ldots \,        \,        \,         \\\\
                                                \\ldots \,        \,        \,        \,         \\\\
                                                \\end{array}\\right)
                                            \\end{array}\\right)
                                        \\end{array}\\right)
                                    \\end{array}\\right)

    assuming we want to enumerate using interleaving:

    .. math::

        s_{00}, s_{10}, s_{01}, s_{20}, s_{02}, s_{11}, s_{03}, s_{30}, s_{04}, s_{12}, s_{05}, s_{21}\ldots

    which, although *complete*, is *unbalanced* in favor of first streams.

    :param callable mplus: states space enumeration strategy
    :return: an ``iter`` object over satisfying ``state`` objects
    '''
    yield from mplus(map(g, α))
