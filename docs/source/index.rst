Introduction
------------

Welcome to documentation of *ηkanrenpy*, a *pythonic* implementation of a
*relational interpreter* and an effort to port the `original code written in
Scheme <ηkanren_scheme_>`_ by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. We report
their words to describe what this work is about:

    This paper presents μKanren, a minimalist language in the miniKanren family of
    relational (logic) programming languages. Its implementation comprises fewer
    than 40 lines of Scheme. We motivate the need for a minimalist miniKanren
    language, and iteratively develop a complete search strategy. Finally, we
    demonstrate that through sufficient user-level features one regains much of the
    expressiveness of other miniKanren languages. In our opinion its brevity and
    simple semantics make μKanren uniquely elegant.
